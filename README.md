# 🍽️ Mood To Meal Application

This project is a **machine learning web application** that recommends suitable meals based on the user's mood.  
It combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier** to predict emotions from text and suggest matching meals.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system that can understand a user's mood from their text input and provide food recommendations that fit their emotional state.  
The system demonstrates **sentiment analysis, classification, and web integration** in a practical use case.

## Features
- **Mood Classification:** Predicts user mood using Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF vectorization for text representation  
- **Web Integration:** Flask-based web interface for user interaction  
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Instant mood detection and meal recommendation  
- **Visualization:** Displays mood results and related food suggestions dynamically

##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Collect and preprocess text data** (user mood inputs)  
2. **Convert text** into numerical features using TF-IDF  
3. **Train and evaluate** Multinomial Naive Bayes model  


## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy,  TF-IDF Vectorizer
